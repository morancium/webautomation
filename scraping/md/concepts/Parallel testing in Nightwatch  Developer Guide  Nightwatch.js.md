Nightwatch supports running the tests in parallel in two main ways:

-   via test workers
-   by running multiple test environments in parallel

### Via test workers

When this is enabled the test runner will launch a configurable number of child processes and then distribute the loaded tests over to be ran in parallel.

Test concurrency is done at the file level. Each test file will fill a test worker slot. Individual tests/steps in a test file will not run concurrently.

### Multiple environments

Nightwatch also supports running tests across multiple browsers in parallel.

You can create a separate environment per browser (by chaining `desiredCapabilities`) and then run them in parallel. In addition, using the `filter` and `exclude` options tests can be split per environment in order to be ran in parallel.

### Via workers + multiple environments

It is very useful to be able to run your tests against multiple browsers in parallel and also distribute your testcases across multiple workers. From **v1.7** you are able to do just that.
